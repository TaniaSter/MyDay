# MyDay
The Koding Virtual Hackathon 2016 project

This small web app is designed to either help you check basic things (time, date, weather, "todo" checklist, 
chatting(both for leisure and business purposes), editing texts, files etc) when your PC/laptop is switched on,
or can be integrated into other web apps as a component.

The project is built with jQuery, AngularJS, PHP, css/"animate.css"
